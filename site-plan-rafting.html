    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>The purpose of Dry Oar White Water Rafting website is to give rafting enthusiasts a great place to start their white water rafting adventure. We are a good informational site for seekers
        to find answers to questions about rafting - such as, what equipment should be taken when running a river? When is the best time and season to launch for the biggest rapids, 
        or the calmest, most scenic, floats? How safe is river running? Any, and all, serious questions concerning white water rafting are encouraged. Afterall, the only bad questions are
        the one's that aren't asked. Dry Oar Rafting offers many adventure packages, everything from short three hour rapid runs, to six night-seven day excursions.
        The Alaska's Tana river, where we are located, offers all types of river experiences from class IV / V rapids for the extreme thrill seekers and experienced water hounds, to slow, wide, meandering
        sections, through some of the most breathtaking and awe-inspiring vistas imaginable, for those who desire a more relaxing experience. Whatever your desires Dry Oar is here to help you
        plan your amazing trip with confidence. </p>
